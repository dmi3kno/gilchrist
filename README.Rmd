This package is made to honor the legacy and memory of Warren G. Gilchrist (1932-2015)^[See @davies2016WarrenGilchrist19322015 for a short biography of this truly remarkable individual].

The goal of `{gilchrist}` is to implement Gilchrist QF transformation rules [@gilchrist2000StatisticalModellingQuantile] in R in the form of pipeable function factories.

## Installation

You can install the development version of gilchrist like so:

``` r
remotes::install_packages("dmi3kno/gilchrist")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(gilchrist)
library(magrittr)
## basic example code
```

In using and testing quantile function it is useful to have an equi-spaced grid of probabilities

```{r}
p_grd <- seq(0,1, by=0.2)
```

Start with standard exponential quantile function

$$Q(u)=-\ln(1-u)$$

and add location and scale parameters. We compare our hand-made exponential quantile function to the standard function in R. Note that `qexp` misses (defaults to 0) the location argument and reciprocates the scale.

```{r logistic}
sqf_exp

qf_exp <- sqf_exp %>% 
  qff_decorate()

qf_exp(p_grd, location=0, scale=10)
# compare to standard exponential quantile function. 
qexp(p_grd, 1/10)
```

Let's do a more challenging example. We will make a logistic distribution in `{gilchrist}`. Logistic distribution consists of exponential and reflected exponential distribution. This is how we do it.

```{r}
qf_logistic <- sqf_exp %>% 
  qff_add(
    sqf_exp %>% qff_reflect()
  ) %>% 
  qff_decorate()

qf_logistic(p_grd, location=4, scale=2)
qlogis(p_grd, 4, 2)
```

Can we add a little flatness to our newly made logistic distribution? Lets make Flattened Skew-Logistic Distribution described in @sharma2020QuantileBasedApproachSupervised.

```{r}
qf_fsld <- sqf_exp %>% 
  qff_mix(
    sqf_exp %>% qff_reflect()
  ) %>% 
  qff_add(sqf_unif) %>% 
  qff_decorate()

qf_fsld(p_grd, wt=0.21, location=4, scale=2)
qpd::qfsld(p_grd, bt=2, k=1, dlt=0.21, a=4)
```

Last one for this short tutorial. We make Weibull distribution. Weibull distribution is a Q-transformed  exponential distribution. The transformation function is the the exponent $T(x)=x^a$.

```{r}
qf_weibull <- sqf_exp %>% 
  qtr_power() %>% 
  qff_decorate()
qf_weibull(p_grd, location=0, scale=2, pow=1/4)
qweibull(p_grd, shape=4, scale=2)
```

Therefore, you can compose new quantile functions following Gilchrist transformation rules.
