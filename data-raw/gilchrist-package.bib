  abstract = {Distributions with bounded support show considerable sparsity over those with unbounded support, despite the fact that there are a number of real-world contexts where observations take values from a bounded range (proportions, percentages, and fractions are typical examples). For proportion modelling, a flexible family of two-parameter distribution functions associated with the exponential distribution is proposed here. Mathematical and statistical properties of the novel distribution are examined, including quantiles, mode, moments, hazard rate function, and its characterization. The parameter estimation procedure using the maximum likelihood method was carried out, and applications to environmental and engineering data were also considered. To this end, various statistical tests are used, along with some other information criterion indicators to determine how well the model fits the data. The proposed model is found to be the most efficient plan in most cases for the datasets considered.},

  abstract = {The principle of parsimonious modelling of lifetimes has regained its importance recently. The value of stochastic modelling in dealing with the inevitable uncertainty and risk is nowadays highly appreciated. However, several families of distributions used in stochastic modelling of lifetimes are often non-parsimonious, unnatural, theoretically unjustified, and sometimes unnecessary. Here we propose a transformation for obtaining a new class of parsimonious distributions, and introduce two new distributions using exponential and Weibull as the baseline distribution in this transformation. The behaviour of hazard rates of the distributions are examined along with other analytical properties. Parameter estimation of the proposed models is done using the maximum likelihood method. Using simulation studies, we have shown that the parameters estimated from the distributions are consistent. Further, the new parsimonious life distributions are applied to a real data set. Our models provide a better fit to the data compared to various distributions in the literature.},
