  abstract = {Distributions with bounded support show considerable sparsity over those with unbounded support, despite the fact that there are a number of real-world contexts where observations take values from a bounded range (proportions, percentages, and fractions are typical examples). For proportion modelling, a flexible family of two-parameter distribution functions associated with the exponential distribution is proposed here. Mathematical and statistical properties of the novel distribution are examined, including quantiles, mode, moments, hazard rate function, and its characterization. The parameter estimation procedure using the maximum likelihood method was carried out, and applications to environmental and engineering data were also considered. To this end, various statistical tests are used, along with some other information criterion indicators to determine how well the model fits the data. The proposed model is found to be the most efficient plan in most cases for the datasets considered.},

  abstract = {We introduce the sinh-arcsinh transformation and hence, by applying it to a generating distribution with no parameters other than location and scale, usually the normal, a new family of sinh-arcsinh distributions. This four-parameter family has symmetric and skewed members and allows for tailweights that are both heavier and lighter than those of the generating distribution. The central place of the normal distribution in this family affords likelihood ratio tests of normality that are superior to the state-of-the-art in normality testing because of the range of alternatives against which they are very powerful. Likelihood ratio tests of symmetry are also available and are very successful. Three-parameter symmetric and asymmetric subfamilies of the full family are also of interest. Heavy-tailed symmetric sinh-arcsinh distributions behave like Johnson SU distributions, while their light-tailed counterparts behave like sinh-normal distributions, the sinh-arcsinh family allowing a seamless transition between the two, via the normal, controlled by a single parameter. The sinh-arcsinh family is very tractable and many properties are explored. Likelihood inference is pursued, including an attractive reparameterization. Illustrative examples are given. A multivariate version is considered. Options and extensions are discussed.},

  abstract = {The principle of parsimonious modelling of lifetimes has regained its importance recently. The value of stochastic modelling in dealing with the inevitable uncertainty and risk is nowadays highly appreciated. However, several families of distributions used in stochastic modelling of lifetimes are often non-parsimonious, unnatural, theoretically unjustified, and sometimes unnecessary. Here we propose a transformation for obtaining a new class of parsimonious distributions, and introduce two new distributions using exponential and Weibull as the baseline distribution in this transformation. The behaviour of hazard rates of the distributions are examined along with other analytical properties. Parameter estimation of the proposed models is done using the maximum likelihood method. Using simulation studies, we have shown that the parameters estimated from the distributions are consistent. Further, the new parsimonious life distributions are applied to a real data set. Our models provide a better fit to the data compared to various distributions in the literature.},

The main properties of the new model are derived, such as quantile function, moments, the moment of residual life, stress strength reliability parameter, order statistics, extreme value distribution, Shannon entropy, and Renyi entropy. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is considered for the parameter estimation, and the information matrix is obtained. Simulation studies were used to assess the performances of the estimators by discussing their bias, mean square error, confidence interval, and coverage probability. In addition, we discussed the quantile regression model based on the proposed model; we examined the performance of their MLEs by simulation studies via the randomized quantile residuals. Two real data sets are used to illustrate the importance of the new model in practice.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To prepare the percentile-based acceptance sampling plans for the Exponentiated Inverse Kumaraswamy Distribution (EIKD) at a specific truncation time to inspect the defective lots corresponding to the desired acceptance level. Methods: The failure probability value is estimated using the cumulative probability function F(.) at time `t' which is converted in terms of the scale parameter {$\sigma$} as 100th percentile using quantile function. The minimum size of the sample, Operating Characteristic (OC) and the minimum ratios are calculated for a required levels of consumer's as well as producer's risk. Findings: The percentile-based sampling plans are obtained through the minimal size of the sample `n' under a truncated life test with a target acceptance number c in a manner that the proportion of accepting a lot which is not good (consumer's risk) would not be more than . These values are calculated at The function of probability of acceptance for variations in the quality of a lot (OC function) L(p) of the sample plan are evaluated for the acceptance values of c=1 and c=5. The minimum ratio values are calculated for the acceptability of the lot with producers' risk of using the sampling plan. Novelty: The modernity of this study is the designing of the acceptance sampling plans to a non-normal data using an asymmetrical distribution that has all three shape parameters. Also, the monitor of the implementation and suitability of statistical quality control and process control aspects using Exponentiated Inverse Kumaraswamy Distribution when compared to other asymmetrical distributions which has at least one scale parameter.

  abstract = {Summary. A general class of statistical models for a univariate response variable is presented which we call the generalized additive model for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS). The model assumes independent observations of the response variable y given the parameters, the explanatory variables and the values of the random effects. The distribution for the response variable in the GAMLSS can be selected from a very general family of distributions including highly skew or kurtotic continuous and discrete distributions. The systematic part of the model is expanded to allow modelling not only of the mean (or location) but also of the other parameters of the distribution of y, as parametric and/or additive nonparametric (smooth) functions of explanatory variables and/or random-effects terms. Maximum (penalized) likelihood estimation is used to fit the (non)parametric models. A Newton--Raphson or Fisher scoring algorithm is used to maximize the (penalized) likelihood. The additive terms in the model are fitted by using a backfitting algorithm. Censored data are easily incorporated into the framework. Five data sets from different fields of application are analysed to emphasize the generality of the GAMLSS class of models.},
